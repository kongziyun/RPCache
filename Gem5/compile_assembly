1. Compile an assembly: gcc -O2 -S -c test.c

	 or

	 gcc -S -masm=intel test.c (intel style is more readable)

2. See the C code together with assembly it converts to:  gcc -c -g -Wa,-a,-ad [other GCC options] test.c > test.lst

3. There's someway to compile C code with assembly together, but I need some specific code to work with.

4. explanation of the assembly:
	 line 19 : add DWORD PTR [rbp-4], eax
		rbp is a register, the memory address is computed by rbp-4
		this line is converted from test_num += i
		
		so we can lock and unlock before and after this line
